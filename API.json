      "overview": "In the dark room of life we hear important echo messages coming from an unknown source, so difficult to decipher, echoes of the invisible, a poetry collection of solutions, light and revelations. In the book, the poet stretched his hands wide in discussing virtually all angles of human life, emotional, social, moral, and economical aspects of life. Echoes of the invisible; the writer used himself as a point of contact to people out there. It is magical in the sense that whoever picks this book must find a poem that resolves, discusses, consoles and confirms his current situation. He calls it the healing poem or the poems of revival. The wordings in a way tried to reconcile the vices in the society; it is a book for all, as it is more than just a poetic work of art.",
